# SQL_Projects

Welcome to my SQL projects repository! I've created this repository to share some of my personal projects that I've worked on in my spare time. I hope you find them interesting and informative.

The projects in this repository cover a wide range of topics, from database design to data manipulation and analysis. I've included the SQL code used for each project, as well as a brief explanation of the problem addressed and the insights gained from the analysis.

I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
